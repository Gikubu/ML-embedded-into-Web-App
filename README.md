# ML embedded into Web App
 In this project, I will build a machine learning model to predict sepsis from a dataset of patient data. I will use the FastAPI framework to create an API that integrates the ML model. The API will be used by a web app to classify sepsis cases. Finally, I will containerize the application using Docker.
